                <p>I regularly dream in javascript, and I love my work.</p>
                <p>I'm a perfectionist, and a hard worker, so you can guarantee I'll be putting out my best work all the time. I love what I do, and am extremely focussed on my work, so I often find that 3 hours have passed by in the blink of an eye, while I've been having the time of my life writing code.</p>
                <p>As a coder, I love to learn new technologies. I still get a thrill when I try something new and I see it work on my screen - it never gets old. I've loved my career so far - making awesome things can't even be called a job, it's just too much fun.</p>
                <p>In my personal time, I like to eat burgers with my husband, make my own clothes, and go walking in beautiful parks and spaces.</p>
                <p>My goal is to be the best coder I can be, and continue to grow in my skill set for many years to come.</p>
